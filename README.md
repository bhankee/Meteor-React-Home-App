### Purpose: To create an application that allows users to login and store home items such as

* Paint Colors
* Hardware
* Appliances
* Flooring

# Technologies Used

## Front End

### React - Used to make sure application is fast due to using the virtual DOM to only render what is neccesary.

### Bootstrap - Used to make app responsive across all devices.

## Back End

### MeteorJS - Used to have the front end talk to the back end using HTTP requests and responses.

### MongoDB - Used to store data that the user inputs. Each user has their own data that they can add or delete.

## Extra

### Google Fonts - To make font styles more attractive to user.
